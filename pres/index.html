CUFF PATTERN: 
1st – 3rd rnd: (K1, P1) around
4th nd rnd: (P1, K1) around

LEG PATTERN: (8-stitch repeat)
1st – 4th rnd: (K7, P1) around
5th rnd: *K2, yo, sl1, K2tog, psso, yo, K2, P1* repeat from * around.
6th rnd: (K7, P1) around
7th – 8th rnd: same as 5th & 6th rnds.

CUFF: With A, cast on 64 sts (21/21/22). Join. Work Cuff Pattern for 2” ending rnd. 3. Cut A.

LEG: With B, begin Leg Pattern, repeating until work measures 5” (or desired length), ending with rnd 8. Cut B

Slip first 31 sts. onto needle 1, leave remaining 33 (instep) st. onto spare needle. Instep should start and end with a P. stitch.

HEEL: (worked over 31 sts.) With A:
1st row: (sl.1, K1) across, end K.1.
2nd row: Sl. 1, P to end.
Repeat these 2 rows until 32 rows completed in total, ending with right side facing.

SHAPE HEEL:
1st row: K 17, ssk, K1, Turn
2nd row: Sl.1, P5, P2tog, P1, Turn
3rd row: Sl.1, K6, ssk, K1, Turn
4th row: Sl.1, P7, P2 tog, P1, Turn
5th row: Sl. 1, K8, ssk, K1, Turn
6th row: Sl.1, P9, P2 tog, P1, Turn
</td><td width="50%">
Continue working in this manner until all stitches have been worked ending with a P row. (17sts) Cut A.

GUSSETTS: With B:
1st needle: K17 heel st.,Pick up and knit 16 sts along side of heel.
2nd needle: continue 33 instep sts in pattern as established.
3rd needle: Pick up and knit 16 sts along side of heel. K9 heel st. (24/33/25)

Beginning rnd at center of heel:
1st rnd: 1st needle: K to last 3 sts. K2tog, K1.
2nd needle: work pattern
3rd needle: K1, ssk, K to end.
2nd rnd: 1st needle: Knit
2nd needle: work pattern
3rd needle: Knit
Repeat these 2 rnds, keeping continuity of pattern on 2nd needle of 33 instep stitches until 64 sts remain. (15/33/16)

FOOT: Continue even on these 64 sts. Knitting 1st and 3rd needles and continuing pattern on 2nd needle until foot measures 2” less than desired length of foot. Cut B.

Slip 1st st. of needle 2 onto needle 1. (16,32,16)

TOE: With A: 1st rnd: 1st needle: K to last 3 sts. K2 tog, K1
2nd needle: K1, ssk, K to last 3 sts. K2 tog, K1
3rd needle: K1, ssk, K to end.
2nd rnd: Knit
Repeat these 2 rnds until 20 sts. remain (5/10/5)

The output from this program is actually a (butterfly rib) sock. Run it again
to get a pair. Knitting socks is an algorithmic art.
